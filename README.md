**WHAT THIS ABOUT:**


Linux based Caesar Cipher Cryptography and ROT13 Algorithm to perform cipher & decipher.


**HOW TO USE IT:**

1. Clone or Download all files in a directory from below link:

   ```https://github.com/Khondakar/Cryptography-Caesar-Cipher-ROT13-Algorithm-For-Cipher-Decipher.git```
   
2. Option 1: User can provide command line argument (text only) and perform cipher & decipher.

   ```./cc.sh THIS is a test```
